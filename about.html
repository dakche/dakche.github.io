                            Having come from a non-engineering background, I've been teaching myself engineering concepts <br>and skills
                            using the internet and books and applying my skills through independent projects <br>and school projects.
                            I am skilled in mechanical CAD and FEA analysis, electrical circuit design <br>and simulation, and 
                            embedded microcontroller programming to complete most mid-sized projects <br>by myself, but I enjoy working 
                            with and learning from other people more knowledgable than me.<br>
                            My interest is lies in power electronics including DC-DC converters, motor control, <br>battery charging, 
                            solar conversion, grid storage, etc. <br><br><a href="#"><span class="hidden">Having not done webdev before, the three days I spent building this website from scratch 
                            <br>taught me one thing: I really don't like webdev. Like, why won't the divs go where you want them <br>to go? Why isn't the CSS getting animated the way I want? AHHH WHY??? SEND HELPPPP!!! <br> Also, the file management for 
                            this website is probably not ideal. Like I mentioned, I'm currently <br>just a self-taught hack when it comes to coding (and with 
                            most things) so right now I do things <br>the unconventional way, but this will change as I learn.</span></a>
