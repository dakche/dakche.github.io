                        <u>Intro</u><br>
                        I want to take my projects to the next level.
                        <br><br><u>Problem/Inspiration</u><br>
                        I'm currently broke. I came across a Youtube video that explains what factors to look for when deciding what stocks to buy.
                        What the heck, let's give it a shot! <br>
                        <br><u>The Process</u><br>
                        The plan was simple:<br>
                        <em>1. Ask the user what stocks they want to research.</em><br>
                        <em>2. Webscrape Yahoo Finance for stock data</em><br>
                        <em>3. Process the numbers and display them in terminal.</em><br>
                        <br><u>Remarks</u><br>
                        Yea...Yahoo isn't as nice as <a href="MySpotlight.html" class="links"><u>APoD</u></a>. The HTML classes are obscure and just a whole lot more painful to find in inspect element. This whole
                        application took me well over 4 hours to write. Other than that, it really was pretty straightforward and stuck to the plan. Some stocks could not be found by my program because not every stock
                        had all the information I was looking for, but at that point, I was exhausted and decided to call it done. <br>
                        But did it work? Eh...kinda? Well the program works but the advice from Youtube didn't make me rich. It did help me avoid
                        a couple of bad stocks though.
