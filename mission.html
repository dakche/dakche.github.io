                    <p><u>TLDR:</u><br>- I am solving problems in my day-to-day life and sometimes having fun. <br>- I want to learn all the skills I can in order to engineer a more sustainable future. <br>- I am broke.<br><br>
                    <u>Longer answer:</u><br> 
                    Every project is an opportunity for me to exercise my creativity and apply the theory <br>I have learned from the internet or from books. However, despite me wanting to produce <br>the most professional looking products, I am often constrained under three constraints:<br><br>
                    <b>Time:</b> Most of my projects are built to solve a time-sensitive problem that my family,<br>friends, or I am facing, so I often prioritize functionality over looks.
                    <br><br><b>Money:</b> The funding for my projects all directly come out of my personal finances, so<br> I may apply...creative solutions using my knowledge of first principles and parts I <br>salvaged from old appliances in order to avoid buying an expensive part. As a bonus, <br>this can also save me time.
                    <br><br><b>Curiosity:</b> Good excuses to spend money on a project don't come often, so I want to <br>apply as much theory as possible and get as much experience as I can out of every project.<br>
                    <br>These three constraints have become so engrained in my projects that they have become <br>my mission: to deliver the highest performing, environmentally responsible, and cost <br>effective solutions to the world's most pressing problems as fast as possible.<br>
                    <br>As you scroll through the archives, you can see the influence of my values and how <br>they have affected my projects. <br><br>So come along, and let's build the future together.
